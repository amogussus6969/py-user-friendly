#Install
To get started, you first (obviously) need python 3 installed.

#Installing python

Go to python.org and download it, if you can't there multiple tutorials on youtube

#Installing Pip
Then if you don't have pip installed, you must install it.

#Step 1
Open your terminal, if you don't know how, you can check on google and your Operating System (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)

#Step 2
Write the following command depending on your operating system

#Linux (anything at this point lol, some toasters run on Linux.) 1% of computers
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
#MacOs (Mac) The computers that cost a leg to have
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
#Windows (PC) Most Computers
py -m ensurepip --upgrade

#Libraries
First we will need to install the requirements for the program to run correctly.

#Using PIP

We will install the libraries using pip

You need to type the following into your terminal (oh and you need to be on the directory where the requirements.txt is, if you dont know how to do that just google it)

pip install -r requirements.txt
